# Welcome to My Research Website

Hello! My name is **Felipe Del Valle**, and I'm a biologist from Chile with a passion for exploring the intricacies of cellular mechanisms. This website is where I share my scientific journey, my current research, and the exciting discoveries I'm making along the way.

## About Me

I began my scientific journey in **Maria Isabel Yuseff’s lab**, where I studied **B cell biology**, specifically focusing on the formation of the immune synapse. This early work sparked my curiosity about the dynamic interactions between immune cells and their environment.

During my **PhD**, I expanded my research to explore **mechanosensing in B cells**—specifically, how mechanical cues influence antigen capture and presentation. I became particularly interested in how **lysosomes** respond to changes in the environment, a key component of cellular function that is central to my current research.

Now, I am in the midst of my **postdoctoral research** in **Juan Bonifacino’s lab** at the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)** in the United States. In this phase of my career, I’m diving deeper into the **transport of lysosomes** and studying the **alternative functions** of this organelle in **neuronal models**. My research aims to uncover new insights into how lysosomal function affects neuronal health and function, particularly in relation to neurodegenerative diseases.

### What Drives My Work?

- **Microscopy & Image Analysis**: One of my greatest passions is **microscopy**. I love capturing the fine details of cellular processes through advanced imaging techniques. I also enjoy **image analysis**, using computational tools to extract meaningful data from complex images.
- **Mechanosensing**: Understanding how cells sense and respond to mechanical changes in their environment is a key focus of my work. My PhD laid the foundation, and I continue to build on this research in the context of neuronal cells.
- **Lysosomes**: The diverse functions of lysosomes in cellular biology fascinate me. I am investigating their roles beyond their traditional function in degradation and waste management, particularly in the context of neural health.
