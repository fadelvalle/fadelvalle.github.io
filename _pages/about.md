# Welcome to My Research Website

Hello! My name is **Felipe Del Valle**, and I'm a biologist from Chile with a passion for cell biology, photography and reading.

## About Me

Throughout my career, I have been driven by a passion for science communication and collaboration. While my research journey has taken me deep into the understanding of cellular mechanisms, I have realized making science accessible, engaging, and impactful is an important part of being a scientist. I am committed to distilling complex ideas into formats that resonate with diverse audiences and foster a deeper appreciation of scientific knowledge.

In addition to my research, I have been an advocate for open science and preprint platforms such as bioRxiv. I actively promoted the use of preprints in my previous lab and now contribute to PreLights, a community that curates and highlights cutting-edge research. These experiences have solidified my dedication to democratizing access to scientific knowledge and supporting initiatives that promote transparency and collaboration.


You can explore my publications on Google Scholar or check out my curated preprint highlights on PreLights.
