# Welcome to My Research Website

Hello! My name is **Felipe Del Valle**, and I'm a biologist from Chile with a passion for exploring the intricacies of cellular mechanisms. This website is where I share my scientific journey, my current research, and the exciting discoveries I'm making along the way.

## About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in Juan Bonifacinoâ€™s lab at the NIH, where I study the transport of lysosomes and their alternative functions in neuronal cells.

Throughout my career, I have been driven by a passion for science communication and collaboration. While my research journey has taken me deep into the intricacies of cellular mechanisms, I have realized that my greatest fulfillment comes from making science accessible, engaging, and impactful. I am committed to distilling complex ideas into formats that resonate with diverse audiences and foster a deeper appreciation of scientific knowledge.

In addition to my research, I have been an advocate for open science and preprint platforms such as bioRxiv. I actively promoted the use of preprints in my previous lab and now contribute to PreLights, a community that curates and highlights cutting-edge research. These experiences have solidified my dedication to democratizing access to scientific knowledge and supporting initiatives that promote transparency and collaboration.

My Approach to Science
Transparency and Reproducibility: I believe in setting high standards for transparency, particularly in areas like data presentation and image analysis, to enhance the credibility and replicability of scientific research.
Innovative Communication: Exploring new ways to communicate scientific findings is a priority in my work. From writing and presenting to engaging with diverse communities, I am passionate about bridging the gap between researchers and the public.
Collaboration Across Borders: As a Latin American scientist, I am particularly interested in promoting equitable access to knowledge and fostering a culture of collaboration within underrepresented regions.
Whether through research, writing, or community engagement, my goal is to contribute to a more inclusive and impactful scientific landscape.

You can explore my publications on Google Scholar or check out my curated preprint highlights on PreLights.
