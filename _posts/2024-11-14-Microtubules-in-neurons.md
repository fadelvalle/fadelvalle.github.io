**Summary of "How neurons maintain their axons long-term: an integrated view of axon biology and pathology"**  

This document provides a comprehensive review of axonal biology, emphasizing the interdependent mechanisms that maintain the long-term integrity and functionality of these neuronal projections.  

  

**Main Topics**  

1. **The Axon as a "Cell within a Cell":**  

   * Axons, especially long ones, face the challenge of distance from the soma (cell body).

   * To overcome this, they contain essential organelles in situ, including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), peroxisomes, and endosomal/lysosomal systems, which allow them to function autonomously.

   * This autonomy is illustrated by the example of tiny parasitic wasps that maintain nucleus-free axons in their adult central nervous system (Polilov, 2012).

   * "An axon is, therefore, almost like a cell within a cell, which may explain how the neurons of tiny parasitic wasps can maintain their axons after disconnecting from their nuclei in the adult CNS" (Polilov, 2012).

  

2. **The Critical Importance of Axonal Transport:**  

   * A robust and efficient axonal transport system is crucial for axon survival, delivering essential materials and removing waste products.

   * This system relies on molecular motors traveling along microtubules (MTs), transporting various cargoes like RNA, proteins, vesicles, and organelles.

   * Dysfunctional axonal transport, whether due to defects in motors, MTs, or cargo regulation, is associated with various axonopathies.

  

3. **A Dependency Cycle for Local Homeostasis:**  

   * The document proposes an "axonal homeostasis dependency cycle," where MT integrity, axonal transport, mitochondrial function, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, and cytoskeletal regulation work in concert.

   * Disruption of any of these components can trigger a domino effect, compromising axonal homeostasis and leading to degeneration.

  

4. **The Central Role of Mitochondria:**  

   * Neurons, with their high energy demands, rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production.

   * Axonal mitochondria regulate calcium, undergo fission/fusion, experience local biogenesis, and are eliminated through mitophagy.

   * Mutations in genes related to mitochondrial function and dynamics are implicated in various axonopathies.

   * "Neurons have enormous ATP demands: a single cortical neuron in the resting human brain is estimated to use ~4.7 billion ATP molecules per second" (Zhu et! al., 2012).

  

5. **The Endoplasmic Reticulum: More than a Protein Synthesis System:**  

   * Axonal ER, primarily smooth, plays a crucial role in lipid synthesis and remodeling, calcium homeostasis, and signaling.

   * Its continuous structure along the axon makes it a potential platform for long-distance communication, independent of neuronal conduction.

   * Defects in genes regulating ER morphology and function are also associated with axonopathies.

   * "ER networks in axons have typical smooth ER features: they lack extensive machinery for transmembrane or extracellular protein production but host enzymes for lipid biosynthesis and metabolism, as well as channels and transporters to regulate Ca2+ levels" (O'Sullivan et! al., 2012; Yalçin et! al., 2017; Luarte et! al., 2018).

  

6. **The Importance of Endo/Autophagic/Lysosomal Systems:**  

   * These systems are essential for the degradation and recycling of damaged or unnecessary proteins and organelles, contributing to axonal proteostasis.

   * Dysfunction in these systems, such as in lysosomal storage diseases, can lead to the accumulation of toxic products and axonal degeneration.

  

7. **The Axonal Cytoskeleton: Providing Structure and Support for Transport:**  

   * Actin filaments and MTs form a complex network that provides structural support and serves as pathways for axonal transport.

   * Disruption of this network, whether through mutations in cytoskeletal proteins or alterations in their dynamic regulation, can negatively affect axonal health.

  

8. **Implications for Axonopathies:**  

   * The document argues that classifying axonopathies solely based on the affected organelle is an oversimplification, given the interdependent cycle of axonal homeostasis.

   * Further research is needed to understand the specific vulnerabilities of different neuronal types and to develop therapeutic strategies targeting multiple aspects of the dependency cycle.

   * "As argued previously, different classes of axonopathies cannot be defined as 'mitochondrial,' 'lysosomal storage,' 'cytoskeletal,' or 'transport' diseases" (Figure 5).

  

In summary, this document highlights the complexity and interconnection of axonal biology, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to understand and treat axonopathies.  

  

**MT Curling**  

The phenomenon of microtubule curling, a recognized pathological occurrence in neuronal axons and non-neuronal cells, can be explained by a disturbance in the homeostatic balance of microtubule bundles. Normally, microtubule-binding proteins (MTBP) maintain microtubule bundles, counteracting the damage caused by wear and the mechanical load of axonal transport. However, when this balance tips towards motor-induced damage, curling may occur.  

  

Here are some key points explaining the phenomenon of microtubule curling:  

* Observations from in vitro microtubule sliding assays suggest that motor forces can induce microtubule curling. Once induced, curling may persist as an energetically favorable tubulin conformation, further stabilized by microtubule-binding proteins.

* Mechanisms for guiding axonal microtubules or cortical microtubule clearance are crucial for maintaining microtubule bundle architecture. When these mechanisms fail, bundle arrangements can degenerate into disorganized zones of interwoven microtubules forming curls, a hallmark of pathology in neuronal axons and non-neuronal cells.

* Hyperactivation of motors like kinesin-1, due to a failure in autoinhibition, can also cause microtubule bundle damage and curling. This hyperactivation disrupts the homeostatic balance, leading to curl formation.

* Structural damage to microtubules due to motor-induced wear is another cause of curling. Although repair mechanisms usually respond to these damages, a temporarily weakened microtubule framework may be more susceptible to curling.

* Interestingly, defective axonal transport of essential organelles such as mitochondria and lysosomes has also been linked to microtubule curling. For example, deficient mitochondrial transport, leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces microtubule curling. Similarly, defects in lysosome transport may also cause microtubule curling, possibly due to hyperphosphorylation of tau, a microtubule-associated protein.

  

In summary, the phenomenon of microtubule curling arises from a complex interplay of factors involving motor-induced microtubule bundle damage, dysfunctional regulatory mechanisms, and axonal transport disturbances, highlighting the importance of delicate homeostatic balance within cells.
